# JavaScript standards

## JavaScript

The best available style guide is the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). Use it for reference.

## Linting

eslint-config-airbnb will enforce the use of the airbnb best practices laid out in their style guide.

## Prettier

Out of the box gatsby makes some assumptions about the prettier config that need to be changed

```
{
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "useTabs": false,
  "semi": true,
  "singleQuote": true,
  "jsxSingleQuote": true,
  "bracketSpacing": true,
  "arrowParens": "avoid"
}
```

## React

https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react
eslint-plugin-react

## Gatsby

## Routing (reach router)

## .gitignore

ignore all local/editor specific configuration

ignore the .DS_Store on macOS

ignore node_modules

## Libraries

it is best to avoid importing libraries such a lodash and underscore. While the utilities provided may seem useful, there are likely vanilla JS implementations for the functions you want to use.
