### JavaScript Applications Guidelines

Third and Grove plans to progressively adopt JavaScript as a core technology for building client projects. Having a unified set of standards for all of our projects will allow for faster onboarding, more cohesive codebases, and an overall better developer experience. React is a core technology we plan to utilize along with Gatsby. While Gatsby is a React centric framework, they have made some decisions on code style that diverge from TAG standards. When initially seting up a project with Gatsby, following these guidelines should ensure that all contributions have uniformity.

Gerneral setup guidelines

- npm package to install all style deps? (`yarn add tag-style-lint -D`)
- use Yarn (package manager)
- use prettier
- use pre-commit hooks (https://prettier.io/docs/en/precommit.html [pretty-quick])
- prefer.json config files
