### JavaScript Applications Guidelines

Third and Grove plans to progressively adopt JavaScript as a core technology for building client projects. Having a unified set of standards for all of our projects will allow for faster onboarding, more cohesive codebases, and an overall better developer experience. React is a core technology we plan to utilize along with Gatsby. While Gatsby is a React centric framework, they have made some decisions on code style that diverge from TAG standards. When initially seting up a project with Gatsby, following these guidelines should ensure that all contributions have uniformity.

- [Front End Best Practices](/legacyFrontEndStandards)(legacy)
- [Coding Best Practices](/legacyCodingBestPractices)(legacy)

<!-- Gerneral setup guidelines

- use Yarn (package manager)
- use prettier
- use pre-commit hooks (https://prettier.io/docs/en/precommit.html [pretty-quick])
- prefer '.json' config files -->

## Standards npm package

install all coding style/standards configurations into your project

install:

```
npm i -g tag-standards
```

use:
in project

```
tag-standards install .
```
