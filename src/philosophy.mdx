### JavaScript Applications Guidelines

Third and Grove plans to progressively adopt JavaScript as a core technology for building client projects. Having a unified set of standards for all of our projects will allow for faster onboarding, more cohesive codebases, and an overall better developer experience. React is a core technology we plan to utilize along with Gatsby. While Gatsby is a React centric framework, they have made some decisions on code style that diverge from TAG standards. When initially seting up a project with Gatsby, following these guidelines should ensure that all contributions have uniformity.

- [Coding Best Practices](/legacyCodingBestPractices) (legacy)

## Standards npm package

install all [tag coding style/standards](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tag-standards) configurations into your project

use:
in project root directory

```
npx tag-standards
```

this will install all the dependencies and config files for your project

You will still need to set up your text editor to visually indicate errors and warnings.
